# Learnings and reflections from the project :

It was really a great learning experience working on this project . Our team members were working on Deep learning for the first time so it was hard for us but we were successful to learn about Deep learning and working on it in a project based manner . We were also able to learn about its possibilities in future . Coming from the same university , we knew each otherâ€™s strength and  were moving forward together as a team . Team work was our key to successfully completing our project 

# Future Enhancement:
Our current project is implemented on a static dataset . It can be enhanced with dynamic dataset with real time inputs . Better datasets , more training will lead to much better results and eliminate all possible limitations.Fast running model & secured features.
